# Zooba-AI-Auto-Play
Mobile Game Scripts

Zooba is a mobile game with Battle royale game rules and MOBA style. i.e. you play LOL with PUBG rules.

To obtain high scores and reward, you need to play all the characters to some target levels every two weeks, which may not be fun when you are playing with some disliked characters.

This Zooba auto-play program can help!

You can train your model to be a escaping style player easily (escape is the key ), which can help you get good rank in most of the auto-play games.

I use BlueStacks5 to play Zooba at Windows PC. 

How to use:

1.Place the BlueStacks on the left top corner of your desktop, and run data_acquisition.ipynb(can also be used as py file) when playing Zooba game.
You can also train the model to learn to click start and exit between games. The start and exit button can be reached with Spacebar.

2. run train_model.ipynb to train your model.

3. run auto_play.ipynb when you are in the game, and the model will play Zooba automatically.
